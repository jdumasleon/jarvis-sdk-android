 * Marks the destinations as destination being able to return a result.

 * The result type is defined as the generic argument if this interface and has to be KotlinX Serializable.
 *
 * Use [ComposableResultEffect] or [DialogResultEffect] to observe the result.
 * Use [setResult] to send the result from a destination.
 *
 * ```
 * sealed interface Destinations : Destination {
 *     // ...

 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Opening the same ResultDestination multiple times per screen has to be distinguished by manually sending an
 * identifier to the result destination and this identifier has to be propagated back by the result type.
